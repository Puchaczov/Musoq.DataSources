## Key Features Covered

### Core Components
- **Schema Class**: Main entry point for plugin registration and table management
- **Entity Classes**: Data model definitions with proper C# patterns
- **Table Classes**: Metadata and column definitions
- **RowSource Classes**: Data retrieval and streaming logic
- **Helper Classes**: Property-to-column mappings and schema definitions
- **Library Classes**: Custom functions and domain-specific operations

### Advanced Features
- Multiple data source patterns (synchronous, asynchronous, streaming)
- Custom function development with entity injection
- Environment variable configuration
- Error handling and resource management
- Complex data types and relationships
- Performance optimization techniques

### Development Workflow
- Project setup and configuration
- Component implementation order
- Testing strategies (unit, integration)
- Build and packaging process
- Documentation best practices

## Plugin Architecture Patterns

The guides demonstrate several architectural patterns found in existing plugins:

1. **Simple Data Source** (like System plugin)
   - Basic entity with simple properties
   - Static data generation
   - Minimal configuration

2. **API Integration** (like OpenAI/Ollama plugins)
   - HTTP client integration
   - Configuration through environment variables
   - Custom functions for data processing

3. **Complex Data Source** (like Docker/Kubernetes plugins)
   - Multiple related tables
   - External service integration
   - Rich metadata and helper functions

4. **File-based Sources** (demonstrated in examples)
   - File system operations
   - Data parsing and transformation
   - Streaming large datasets

## Usage Examples

The documentation provides numerous SQL usage examples:

```sql
-- Basic queries
SELECT * FROM #example.data()
SELECT * FROM #example.data(50)

-- Using custom functions
SELECT Id, Name, FormatWithPrefix(Name, 'Item') as Formatted,
       DaysSinceCreation() as Age
FROM #example.data(20)

-- Complex queries with filtering and ordering
SELECT * FROM #example.data(100, 'Technology') 
WHERE Value > 200 AND IsActive = true
ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC
```
